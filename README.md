# ColourNewTab
whatcolourisit.com is a simple website that displays the time as a hex colour (i.e. the hex colour that the digits of the time would be). For example, 2:53:30 in the afternoon becomes 14:53:30 in 24-hour time and then #145330, which is a pleasing dark pine green.

This extension borrows the website source code, adds a few modifications like a date and AM/PM distinctions (for us North Americans), and creates a Chrome extension that overrides the regular New Tab page and gives you a pleasant colour every time you open a new tab.
